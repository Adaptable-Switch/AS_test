## 1.Hardware Design.

In HDL folder, it's hardware design VHDL code files, as figure below shown.

An opensourced packet generator can be find in the project of [PacketGenerator](https://github.com/NetFPGA/netfpga/wiki/PacketGenerator), the packet data can be read from PCAP files.

The key contribution in PL part is the Dispatch module that is combined from source files (1)input_arb.v, (2)crossbar.v and (3)selector.v.

Also we implemented the key module in SS, the module of (1)MMU.v.


Besides, other important modules are the data BUS converter and the output BUS: (1)c8to512.v, (2)lookup.v.

Use cases are implemented in files: (1)statefull.v (2)ndp48.v (3)ndpqs.v (4)measure.v

## 2.Software Design.

The SA-based heuristic algorithm is following the processing graph below.

The algorithm is implemented in heuristic.py file.

The input of the algorithm is the flow group G_id[j] that is generated by classify HASH function and its corresponding traffic volume D_id[j]. The solution w is the distribution of the G_id[j] in EEs. 

The different group distribution contained in the EE generate the total traffic throughput performance demand. The goal of the algorithm is to make demand of each EE as balanced as possible, and does not exceed the maximum processing capacity  of each EE (Pmax), which is a predictable constant.

### 2.1.The initialization of the SA algorithm.

a) 检查是否有某一个D_id[j]超过了EE的处理能力，则需要将它复制为N份，N<=K，每个子group的吞吐 D_id[j]/N < Pmax. 
Check if there is a D_id[j] that exceeds the Pmax, it need to duplicate into N copies (N<=K) and put them on different EE. The throughput demand of each sub-group (D_id[j]/N)<Pmax.

b) 将流组合以及复制的重复组合随机分配到K个集合内，形成初始解w.
Randomly distribute the G_id[j] and duplicated repeated combinations into K sets to form an initial solution w.



### 2.2.Generate new candidate solution in the search area.

A solution is a flow group allocation. To generate new neiboring solution, after the init step of the algorithm, it randomly select a flow group from any one EE(i) to another EE(j).

### 2.3.The evaluation function in SA.

The defination of the evaluation function,![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=J(w)):

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D\\_{id}[j])
is the traffic volume of one of the flow groups, ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=j\in[1,256]).

The total traffic of Execution Engine(i) ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={}=\\sum{D\\_id[j]},(i\in[1,K],j\in{EE_i})).

The evaluation function ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=J(w)=\\sum^{K}_{i=1}(D^{2}_{i}-D^{2}_{average})^{\dfrac{1}{2}}).
this equation represents the traffic load balancing of the table allocation.
